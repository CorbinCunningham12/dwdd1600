This Repository is for my high school Web Developement class, and once that done will become my personal repository. You will find nothing here be the stupidest code known to man and I don't reccomend copying because,
1. I don't make my websites serious if they don't have to be for a grade.
2. My code is so braindead that I want to see how stupid I can make it while still doing well in class.
3. Because copying is cringe and you should do your own work.
